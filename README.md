# EME165

The project will involve more in‐depth analysis or design, and may include programming, parametric evaluation and interpretation of results.

Course Outcomes
As a result of successfully completing this class, students will be able to formulate and
solve problems related to
(1) steady and unsteady conduction heat transfer including analytical and
computational methodologies,
(2) convection heat transfer for external and internal flow situations including an
understanding of the roles of dimensionless parameters as well as laminar and
turbulent flows, and
(3) black body and gray body radiation heat transfer.


Problem Statement
1. An apricot is ripening on a tree. The apricot is do = 4 cm in diameter and can be approximated to be a sphere. The skin can be assumed to be thin. Its spherical seed is ds = 1 cm in diameter, and its thermal conductivity is ks = 0.3 W/m-K. The seed of the apricot has a volumetrically uniform internal heat generation rate of qs’’’= 50,000 W/m3. The flesh of the apricot (i.e., the fruit part) has a volumetrically uniform internal heat generation rate of qf’’’= 100,000 W/m3. The thermal conductivity of the flesh, kf = 0.6 W/m-K. There is a contact resistance between the seed and the flesh of the fruit, estimated at Rtc’’ = 0.02 m2-K/W. A convective breeze blows over the apricot such that the heat transfer coefficient is h = 50 W/m2-K. The freestream temperature is Tinf. The absorptivity to solar radiation of the fruit skin is s = 0.75, while the emissivity and absorptivity to long-wave radiation is 0.85.
Consider the following scenarios:
(a) Daytime: During daytime (see sketch below), solar radiation with a value of Gs = 500 W/m2 is incident over the entire fruit. The fruit exchanges radiation with the surrounding sky that is at a temperature of Tsky = 20 oC, in addition to convection to a freestream at Tinf =15 oC.
Figure illustrating the daytime scenario
(b) Nighttime: At nighttime, the fruit exchanges radiation with the surrounding sky that is at a temperature of Tsky = 5 oC, in addition to convection to a freestream at Tinf =10 oC.
Determine the following for steady state night time and daytime conditions :
1. Temperature distribution within the fruit (inclusive of the seed)
2. Location and value of the maximum temperature
3. Heat gain/loss to/from fruit
4. If for the daytime scenario, solar radiation were only incident on one half of the apricot, what changes would you need to make to the formulation to solve the problem? Discuss with a sketch of the control volumes you would need to use.

Requirements :
1. The code should be in Matlab, python, or other programming language. The code needs to be uploaded onto the gradescope submission portal dedicated for the code
2. A minimum of 10 CVs is needed for the seed, and 20 CVs is needed for the flesh part of the fruit.
